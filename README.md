# **Programming-and-Scripting-Project-2018**

Project Module 'Programming and Scripting' - Dataset used: Iris Dataset and Programming Language: Python

## **Problem-statement**

The following project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set [3]. The project
entails  researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the
Python programming language [1] based on that research. The Fisher iris data is one of the most widley used 

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about
it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

**About-Iris-Data-Set**

The Iris flower data set of information compiled by Ronald Fisher, a biologist, in the 1930s. It describes certain biological characteristics of different types of Iris flowers.The Iris flower data set is now widely used as a data set for testing purposes in computer science.The Iris data set contains measurements in centimeters for the variables sepal length and width, and petal length and width, for 150 flowers from 3 species of iris, Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The data was collected over several years by Edgar Anderson, who used the data to show that the measurements could be used to differentiate between different species of irises. It is split into 5 attributes:

1.Sepal Length

2.Sepal Width

3.Petal Length

4.Petal Width

5.Class

The best exapmle of how this data set is perfect for computing I found during my reaserch was a short article in  [Technopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32880/iris-flower-data-set)

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Investigation
As i am new to progamming a large part of this project was spent trying to understand the importance of the fisher data set in terms of comptuing. As i began to understand the reasons that the data set is used so frequentyy in computing i was amazed that that a statistical and biological study from the 1930s is the basis of testing machine learning software
