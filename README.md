**Project Module** 'Programming and Scripting'  
**Dataset used:** Iris Dataset and Programming Language: Python

## **Problem-statement**

The following project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set [3]. The project
entails  researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the
Python programming language [1] based on that research. The Fisher iris data is one of the most widley used 

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about
it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

**About-Iris-Data-Set**

The Iris flower data set of information compiled by Ronald Fisher, a biologist, in the 1930s. It describes certain biological characteristics of different types of Iris flowers.The Iris flower data set is now widely used as a data set for testing purposes in computer science.The Iris data set contains measurements in centimeters for the variables sepal length and width, and petal length and width, for 150 flowers from 3 species of iris, Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The data was collected over several years by Edgar Anderson, who used the data to show that the measurements could be used to differentiate between different species of irises. It is split into 5 attributes:

1. Sepal Length

2. Sepal Width

3. Petal Length

4. Petal Width

5. Class

The best exapmle of how this data set is perfect for computing and data analytics I found during my reaserch was a short article in  [Technopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32880/iris-flower-data-set)


## Investigation

### Methodology

1. Download the iris data set as a .csv file.
2. Load the iris data set into visual studio code.
3. Load the NumPy,Matplotlib and seaborn python libraries using ipython
4. Create python code to return the min, max and mean values of the data and the standard deviation.
5. Create python code to return histograms and scatterplot graphs of the varibles in the data.

### Findings
The dataset contains a 150 samples sets of measurements from three species of Iris flowers, Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. Sepal length ranged from 4.3cm to 7.9cm. Sepal width ranged from 5cm to 5.7cm . Petal length ranged from 3.6cm to 6.9cm. Petal width ranges from 0.1cm to 2.5cm.From figure 6 the ratio of length to width can be seen. The Iris setosa is signicantly diferent in terms of size of petal and sepal compared to the other two samples .
