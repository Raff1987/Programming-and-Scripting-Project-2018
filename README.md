**Programming-and-Scripting-Project-2018**

Project Module 'Programming and Scripting' - Dataset used: Iris Dataset and Programming Language: Python

**Problem-statement**

The following project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set [3]. The project
entails you researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the
Python programming language [1] based on that research.
An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people
have investigated and written about it previously, and many of those are not experienced
programmers. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks
that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. You
might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about
it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

**About-Iris-Data-Set**

The Iris data set contains measurements in centimeters for the variables sepal length and width, and petal length and width, for 150 flowers from 3 species of iris, Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The data was collected over several years by Edgar Anderson, who used the data to show that the measurements could be used to differentiate between different species of irises.
